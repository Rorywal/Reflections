What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

By default, a given folder is not configured as repository and this means
that you can't store commits etc. in the metadata. Using "Git Init" will
create the repository.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area can be thought of as being a "half-way-house" between the
working directory and the repository. You may, for example, have been working
on a file but are not ready to commit yet. The staging area allows you to 
store a file ready to be committed without actually committing it. This is
useful because you might want to group a commit with changes for another file.
You might also be unsure about the changes you've made and want to double check
before committing.
